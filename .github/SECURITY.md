Voici comment on gère la sécurité sur notre site

## Comment rapporter une vulnérabilité

Security issues can be reported by sending an email to security@prestashop.com or by our [YesWeHack Bug Bounty Program](https://yeswehack.com/programs/prestashop), which will go to security team members.
The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. 
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

 - Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
 - Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
 - Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible.
